# VAYU-weather-station-and-soil-monitoring-system
IoT Based weather monitoring and soil monitoring system
VAYU is an innovative system that monitors weather conditions and soil health in real time, designed to help farmers make smarter decisions. Using sensors like DHT11 for temperature and humidity, BMP180 for pressure, and soil moisture sensors, it collects vital data about the environment. The data is stored on an SD card and shared via Bluetooth for easy access.

This project is impactful because it provides actionable insights, improving crop management, irrigation, and yield, making it a step forward in sustainable agriculture.
